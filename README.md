Dataset: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1F3lRf32JM8ejnXq-Cbf9y7fa57zSHGz_/view?usp=sharing
Here doing data exploration,data cleaning,data analysis,encoding and feature scaling.
Explore the data, list down the unique values in each feature and find its length.
Perform the statistical analysis and renaming of the columns.
Find the missing and inappropriate values, treat them appropriately.
Remove all duplicate rows.
Find the outliers by using IQR method
Replace the value 0 in age as NaN
Treat the null values in all columns using any measures(removing/ replace the values with mean/median/mode)
Filter the data with age >40 and salary<5000
Plot the scatterplot with age and salary
Count the number of people from each place and represent it visually by using count plot.
Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques such as one-hot encoding, label encoding, making them suitable for analysis by machine learning algorithms.
After the process of encoding, perform the scaling of the features using standardscaler and minmaxscaler.
